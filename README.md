# 📚 PaperOntime – Academic Support Website (Built on Wix with Custom Code)

---

## Overview:
PaperOntime is an academic support platform built on Wix, designed to provide students with access to academic proofreading, editing, and tutoring services. While Wix provides the foundation, the website's functionality — especially the ordering process — was fully customized using Velo by Wix (JavaScript).

## Key Features & Contributions:
✍️ **Fully customized ordering system**: Implemented a multi-step order form using Velo code to capture detailed client requests (e.g., subject, academic level, deadline).

🔐 **Conditional logic and validations**: Integrated dynamic form behavior based on user selections (e.g., hiding/showing fields).

💬 **Client interaction enhancements**: Created automated response messages and input feedback to streamline the ordering experience.

📤 **Data handling**: Configured backend services to store submissions in Wix's database collections for secure retrieval and management.

💳 **Stripe payment integration**: Connected the ordering system directly to Stripe for secure and seamless online payments.

🧠 **Logic-based pricing suggestions**: Coded logic for preliminary quote estimation based on selected order parameters (if applicable).

🎨 **Branding and visual identity**: Designed and implemented the full brand identity, including logo and color palette. Customized purchased illustrations to align with brand colors and maintain visual consistency across the site.
